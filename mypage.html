    Hello! My name is Abhay Sharma and I am currently pursuing my studies at 
    <strong>IIIT Hyderabad</strong>, one of Indiaâ€™s leading institutes for 
    technology and research. I have a deep interest in programming, data-driven 
    problem solving, and building applications that can create real-world impact. 
    Over the course of my studies, I have been developing a strong foundation in 
    computer science, with a focus on coding, algorithms, and emerging 
    technologies like machine learning and artificial intelligence.
